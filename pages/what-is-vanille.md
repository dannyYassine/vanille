# What is `vanilla`?

## Overview

`vanille` (French word for "vanilla") is a minimalistic framework aim to have an almost zero footprint building web applications.

The joy of building javascript applications with vanilla javascript inspired the creation of a framework with the standardized bare essentials:

- Templating with JSX
- Pass `objects` to custom element attributes
- Observable `props` and `state`

::: tip

Vanilla goes well with so many things because its foundational yet tasty makeup helps it stand out as incredibly versatile. No other flavor can be combined quite the same. Root beer floats and banana splits both begin with the same flavor of ice cream: vanilla. Its universal appeal is that of nothing else.
